- **Aim 1**: Accelerate data reuse through enhanced data discovery
    - *Project 1.1*: Update Databrary’s search engine and user interfaces
    - *Project 1.2*: Update Databrary’s backend to support storage of multiple annotation layers and develop interfaces to depict multiple annotation layers
- **Aim 2**: Ease data reuse with custom collections that automatically track provenance across sources
    - *Project 2.1*: Create new custom collections of shared videos for reanalysis
- **Aim 3**: Expand data sharing via workspaces that support active curation, thereby reducing the lag between data analysis and open sharing
    - *Project 3.1*: Implement “workspaces” for in-progress research projects
    - *Project 3.2*: Update Databrary’s UI to permit flexible views of datasets
- **Aim 4**: Promote research transparency and reproducibility by expanding scriptable access to Databrary functions
    - *Project 4.1*: Polish, document, and promote Databrary’s API
    - *Project 4.2*: Update [databraryr](https://github.com/databrary/databraryr) and develop and release a Python package, databrarypy, for accessing Databrary
    - *Project 4.3*: Create and publish sample scripts and introduce the new automation tools to the research community
    - *Project 4.n^[Not in proposal but thematically related to this aim.]*: Update online user [guide](https://databrary.github.io/guide).
- **Aim 5**: Enhance the value of existing data stored on Databrary by adding searchable metadata and sharing unshared data
    - *Project 5.1*: Make existing shared datasets more readily findable
    - *Project 5.2*: Curate unshared datasets and release them for wider use
