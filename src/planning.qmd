### Agenda

#### Overview

- What and why

#### Aims/Projects
  
- **Aim 1**: Accelerate data reuse through enhanced data discovery
    - *Project 1.1*: Update Databrary’s search engine and user interfaces
    - *Project 1.2*: Update Databrary’s backend to support storage of multiple annotation layers and develop interfaces to depict multiple annotation layers
- **Aim 2**: Ease data reuse with custom collections that automatically track provenance across sources
    - *Project 2.1*: Create new custom collections of shared videos for reanalysis
- **Aim 3**: Expand data sharing via workspaces that support active curation, thereby reducing the lag between data analysis and open sharing
    - *Project 3.1*: Implement “workspaces” for in-progress research projects
    - *Project 3.2*: Update Databrary’s UI to permit flexible views of datasets
- **Aim 4**: Promote research transparency and reproducibility by expanding scriptable access to Databrary functions
    - *Project 4.1*: Polish, document, and promote Databrary’s API
    - *Project 4.2*: Update [databraryr](https://github.com/databrary/databraryr) and develop and release a Python package, databrarypy, for accessing Databrary
    - *Project 4.3*: Create and publish sample scripts and introduce the new automation tools to the research community
- **Aim 5**: Enhance the value of existing data stored on Databrary by adding searchable metadata and sharing unshared data
    - *Project 5.1*: Make existing shared datasets more readily findable
    - *Project 5.2*: Curate unshared datasets and release them for wider use

### Follow-up

- Return to two-week sprints, starting 2025-03-11
- Plan to focus on DB2.0 deliverables first
- Begin planning *Custom Collections* (Aim 2)

## Custom Collections

- See Aim 2/Project 2.1

### Use cases

- Select files, sessions, volumes shared by others and clone them to my own volume
  - Add select box to UI?
  - Bookmark/shopping cart metaphor for UI
- Volume owner notification
  - Notify *that* files were cloned, but not *by whom*?
  - Part of volume-level analytics
- Maintain file provenance
  - UI indicates cloned files
  - Backend links to citation/source
  - New annotation layers add link back to source volume
    - How do annotation files get linked to source video/audio in backend?
  - Custom collections can include cloned and new material
- Edge cases
  - What happens to cloned items if original owner modifies or deletes them?
  - What happens to shared volumes containing cloned material when the owner modifies or deletes them?
  - Who can create custom collections?
    - Must have account
    - Premium feature (at member institution)?
    - Have read privileges on private volume
    
## Search

- See Aim 1/Project 1.1

### Use cases/user stories

- Prioritize search based on user's recent searches, their own volumes.
- Separate or make selectable search for volumes, institutions, users, files/videos
- Suggest "popular" searches, see [screenshot](include/img/our-world-in-data-search.png) from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org). Also Google Search [screenshot](include/img/google-search-screenshot.png).
