## Values

- As open as possible
- As closed as necessary

## Vision

- Databrary as *the* leader in open behavioral science
- Not just a repository
- Tool for discovery

# Overview of Aims

## Aim 1: Enhanced data discovery

- Why: Accelerate data reuse
- How:
  - Enhanced Search
  - Annotation layers: Search & visualize
  
## Aim 2: Custom collections

- Why: 
  - Make data reuse easier
  - PLAY Project release
- How:
  - Select, clone/copy shared files, sessions, metadata, volumes
  - Maintain virtual links
  - AKA "virtual volumes"
  
## Aim 3: Workspaces

- Why: 
  - Active curation [@Soska2021-mh] $>>$ *post hoc*
  - In progress $\neq$ published/shared
- How:
  - Workspace with essential DB2 metadata
  - Flexible views
  - Semi-automated curation for sharing
  
## Aim 4: Scriptable access

- Why: Transparency & reproducibility
- How:
  - DB2 API
  - Secure authentication
  - Update [databraryr](https://databrary.github.io/databraryr)
  - Develop & publish *databrarypy*

## Aim 5: Curation

- Why: Self-curation idiosyncratic
- How:
  - Review fully shared, overview only, private
  - Curate
